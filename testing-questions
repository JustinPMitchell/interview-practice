What tools would you use to test your code's functionality?
I have used mocha and chai to test my code so far.  Mocha is the library that allows you to do your testing and chai is the assertion library that we used to see our tests in.  My mentor recently showed me some Sellenium, so I could get a better idea of what that looks like and New Relic.  She also recommended that I look at casper.js, backstop.js, and CSS regressions.

What is the purpose of a code style linting tool?
Style linting is a static analysis of code to see if adheres to certain standards.  It checks your code to make sure your spaces are up to standard.  It keeps things to a certain style so that way anyone can look at it and read more clearly.
